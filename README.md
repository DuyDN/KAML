# KAMBLUP
## Kinship Adjusted Multi-locus Best Linear Unbiased Prediction
`KAMBLUP` is compatible with both [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Microsoft R Open](https://mran.microsoft.com/open/), We highly recommend **MRO** instead of **R** for running `KAMBLUP`. **MRO** is the enhanced distribution of **R**, it includes multi-threaded math libraries. These libraries make it possible for so many common R operations, ***such as matrix multiply/inverse, matrix decomposition, and some higher-level matrix operations***, to compute in parallel and use all of the processing power available to [reduce computation times](https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/multithread/#mt-bench).
